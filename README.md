## Hi, I’m Puskar 👋

I’m a **2nd-year Computer Science student** focused on building **reliable, workflow-driven software systems** using Python, with a strong interest in **AI-powered automation** and how intelligent systems behave in real-world conditions.

Rather than jumping straight into high-level AI tools, I’m deliberately building strong foundations — writing clean code, designing small systems, and understanding how **decision-making, state, and iteration** actually work. My goal is to grow into someone who can build **robust AI workflows and agent-like systems**, not just demos.

## 🧠 What I’m Working On

### 🔹 Python & System Foundations (core focus)
- Writing modular, readable Python code
- Structuring programs into reusable functions and components
- Working with files, data, and simple stateful workflows
- Building small systems that handle errors and edge cases

### 🔹 AI Workflows & Agentic Thinking
- Designing programs that:
  - observe inputs
  - make decisions
  - take actions
  - evaluate outcomes
  - iterate or adapt
- Focusing on **logic and reliability first**, before adding models or frameworks
- Exploring how AI fits into workflows rather than replacing them

### 🔹 Applied AI & ML (progressive)
- Planning to move into applied machine learning once core systems feel natural
- Interested in using ML as a decision component inside larger workflows
- Long-term interest in agentic systems that combine rules, data, and learning

### 🔹 Security & Web3 (exploratory)
- Exploring how automation and analysis can support safer decentralized systems
- Learning how structured workflows and AI-assisted analysis can improve security tooling

## 🛠 Tools & Environment

- **Language:** Python (primary)
- **Workflow:** Git, Linux, CLI-based development
- **Practices:** version control, automation scripts, reproducible builds
- **Mindset:** build small → test → iterate → document

---

## 🚀 Roadmap (2025–2026)

- Build and document multiple small, well-structured Python systems
- Progress toward **AI-driven workflows and agent-like projects**
- Contribute meaningfully to beginner-friendly open-source projects
- Grow toward **GSoC 2026**, focusing on long-term impact over short-term visibility

---

## 📈 Proof of Work (in progress)

- Python workflow experiments and system prototypes
- Gradual public documentation of learning and design decisions
- Projects that prioritize clarity, reliability, and reasoning over scale
